# EasyCPDLC
Making CPDLC actually usable for pilots on VATSIM

# What is EasyCPDLC?
EasyCPDLC is a third-party CPDLC client designed for use with the Hoppie ACARS network and VATSIM. It allows users to communicate with ATC and other CPDLC-equipped aircraft even when not using an aircraft that natively supports CPDLC.

# How does it work?
The program requires only your VATSIM CID and Hoppie logon code. It uses this information to query the network and confirm your flight details, which it then stores and prefills into the relevant sections. From there, you can proceed to logon to a CPDLC unit, request a datalink clearance, or pursue any of the hundreds of other uses of CPDLC

# Is there a tutorial?

# How do I get it?
You can download the latest release [here.](https://github.com/josh-seagrave/EasyCPDLC/releases)

# It's broken. What do I do?
EasyCPDLC is still under active development. If you encounter crashes or a bug, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/josh-seagrave/EasyCPDLC/issues) with as much detail as possible so I can investigate.
