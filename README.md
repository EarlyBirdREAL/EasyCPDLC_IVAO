# EasyCPDLC_IVAO
Making CPDLC actually usable for pilots on IVAO

# What is EasyCPDLC_IVAO?
EasyCPDLC_IVAO is a third-party CPDLC client designed for use with the Hoppie ACARS network and IVAO. It allows users to communicate with ATC and other CPDLC-equipped aircraft even when not using an aircraft that natively supports CPDLC.
It is based on [EasyCPDLC by Joshua Seagrave](https://github.com/quassbutreally/EasyCPDLC)

# How does it work?
The program requires only your IVAO VID and Hoppie logon code. It uses this information to query the network and confirm your flight details, which it then stores and prefills into the relevant sections. From there, you can proceed to logon to a CPDLC unit, request a datalink clearance, or pursue any of the hundreds of other uses of CPDLC

# Is there a tutorial?
It's in development. But it is pretty straight forward.

# How do I get it?
You can download the latest release [here.](https://github.com/EarlyBirdREAL/EasyCPDLC_IVAO/releases)

# It's broken. What do I do?
EasyCPDLC_IVAO is still under active development. If you encounter crashes or a bug, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/EarlyBirdREAL/EasyCPDLC_IVAO/issues) with as much detail as possible so I can investigate.

# Is it free?
Yes, and it always will be.

# I'd like to buy you a coffee, you seem like you need one.
